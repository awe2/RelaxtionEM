# Laplacian Relaxation vs Physically Informed Neural Network

### Purpose:

This Repository houses a single jupyter notebook that will demonstrate the relaxation method for finding a numerical solution to Laplace's equation on a 2D grid with user defined boundary conditions. The notebook was developed for Phys 7401 Spring 2025 to learn more about this method

In addition to demonstrating the Relaxation method, I also show how to use a neural network to find a numerical solution using a Physically Informed Neural Network (PINN), which is a developing technique used to solve more complicated fields.

### Conclusion

While obviously a problem as simple as this doesn't really require a PINN solution, they are being investigated for more complicated problems or more generally to constrain functions to arbitrary constraints that can be phrased as differential equations. I encourage the reader to play around with the hyperparameters of the Network, as you'll find slight deviations can cause the PINN to no longer converge.
